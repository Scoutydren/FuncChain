# FuncChain
function chain reaction machine

## How to run
1. In the file directory, right click on FuncChain.uproject and select "Generate visual studio project files"
2. Open the project in unreal engine
3. On the bottom right corner of unreal engine, compile the code. (Note: do not compile in Visual Studio).
4. Basic level is currently in Minimal_Default.

* If the scale seems off, go to project settings -> engine -> user interface. Under DPI Scaling, set application scale to 1.0 (or whatever feels comfortable).
